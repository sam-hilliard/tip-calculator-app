## Overview

In this challenge I built a responsive tip calculator app using React.js.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

Usually with every react project, removing all the bloat that comes with `create-react-app`
and getting the bare minimum working. Then, based off of the design, I decide how many components
I need. From there, I get the components set up and styled (mobile first) before I add any functionality.
Once it's looking right and responsive, I go in and add the necessary states, contexts, and effects to make
my app functional.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned how to use React's context API more effectively and how to write cleaner code for my
components.

### Continued development

One thing I could improve on is to make my React code more modular. I felt that much of my code
could have been broken down further into components to make it more readable.

### Useful resources

- I completed Kevin Powell's [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://www.kevinpowell.co/courses/) course
  in conjunction with finishing this challenge and it helped me get a better grasp of front end design.
